## Background

It's common knowledge that news is a major factor in stock prices. Negative news (bad earnings reports, political & economic uncertainty) will lead individuals to sell stocks and the stock price goes down. While positive news (good earnings reports, new products & acquisitions) will lead individuals to buy stocks and the stock price goes up.

## Vision

Staying up to date about the companies you are investing in is crucial in the present day. However, the way people currently stay up to date has too many steps:

## Current Solutions

1. Take out your phone
2. Unlock your phone
3. Open up one of many mobile apps or web browsers
4. Google or look up your company
5. Search for relevant news for that company

OR

1. Take out your phone
2. Ask Siri or Alexa: Give me news on Amazon
--> However, the news returned are from a variety of sources and not all of them are great.

INSTEAD:

## My Solution

1. Ask Alexa "Give me an update on companies in my portfolio"
